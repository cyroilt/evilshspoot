> [!NOTE]
> SubViewports in Godot 4 are bugged.
>
> They work, but can be problematic, displaying errors that aren't there, or resetting the texture from time to time.
>
> An example of one such bug is [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/66247).

-   `MeshInstance3D` - Used to display the content SubViewport needs:
    -   `Mesh` (preferably `QuadMesh`)
    -   `MaterialOverride` with `ViewportTexture`
-   `Area3D` - Used for mouse capture.
-   `SubViewport` - Used to render UI.
